2 # Data Types

# data types: numbers, booleans, strings
# Ruby is case-sensitive

my_num = 25
my_boolean = true
my_string = "Ruby"

3 # Variables

# Variable is a word or name that grasps a single value 
# Declaring variables in Ruby: write a name out like my_num and use = to assign it a value

4 # Math

# There are 6 arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, **, %
# ** is exponentiation raises one number (the base) to the power of the other (the exponent)
# % is modulo: returns the remainder of division e.g. 25 % 7 would be 4 since 7 goes into 25 3 times with 4 left over

5 # 'puts' and 'print'

# The print command just takes whatever you give it and prints it to the screen
# Puts for "put string" adds a new (blank) line after the thing you want to print
